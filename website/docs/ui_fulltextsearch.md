Search modes

* "Default" â€” This follows the [xapian search syntax](https://xapian.org/docs/queryparser.html). Note that phrase searching and NEAR operator needs `Enable index with positional information` enabled at settings.
* "Plain text" - mode like "Whole words" but every word in search line can be treated as word fragment.
* "Wildcards" - the search line contains a Unix-like template. Such template can contain wildcard symbols `?` (matches any one character), `*` (matches any character number) or ranges of characters `[...]` To find characters `?`, `*`, `[` and `]` it should be escaped by backslash like `\?`, `\*`, `\[`, `\]`.

"Available dictionaries in group" - here you can view how many dictionaries in the current group are suitable for full-text search, how many dictionaries already indexed and how many dictionaries wait for indexing.

When you place mouse cursor over headword in results list, the tooltip with dictionary list contains such articles matched the search conditions will be shown.

!!! note
    The dictionary will index for full-text search in background and started immediately after program start, name of the currently indexing dictionary is displayed in the status line. This process can take a long time and require many computing resources.You may turn off indexing for huge dictionaries like Wikipedias or Wiktionaries in preferences. To find dictionary which can't be indexed check GoldenDict with `--log-to-file` or check `stdout`.
