![toolbar](img/toolbar.webp)

From left to right:

* Forward/Backward navigation buttons;
* Group selector
* Search Line
* Toggle Scanning
* Play the first pronunciation in found articles;
* Font scale buttons;
* Save the article as HTML
* Print article
* Add to Favorites;

Type your word in Search Box and press `Enter` to search word in the current selected group. You can also choose a variant from matches list.

If Ctrl or Shift key has been pressed the new tab for translation will be created.

### Wildcard matching

The Search Line can contain wildcard symbols `?` (matches any one character), `*` (matches any characters number) or ranges of characters `[...]`. To find characters `?`, `*`, `[` and `]` it should be escaped with backslash like `\?`, `\*`, `\[`, `\]`.

!!! note
    The wildcard symbol at first position in word leads to full headwords list scanning and it may take a long time for huge dictionaries.

## Dictionary Bar

The dictionaries bar contains all dictionaries from current dictionaries group. Click the icons to disable/enable them.

Hold `Shift` and click dictionary bar will temporally focus on a single dictionary. Hold `Shift` and click again to defocus and restore the previous dictionaries bar state.

Hold `Ctrl` and click dictionary bar will toggle between "Enable a single dictionary" and "Enable all dictionary".

Note: The `Shift` and `Ctrl` interaction can also be used on "Found in dictionaries" panel
